# Launch Firefox Reality

This application launches Firefox Reality on GearVR/Oculus Go/Quest.

It can be used in at least two ways:

(1)
Simply launch the application.
If there is text in the clipboard, it will open the first URI found.

(2)
Share a URI from your favorite Android application.
Firefox Reality will launch,
opening the first URI found in the shared text.

### Privacy

As can be seen from a cursory inspection of the brief source code,
Launch Firefox Reality does not store any data.

Enjoy!
