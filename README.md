# Launch Oculus Browser

This application launches the new Oculus Browser on GearVR compatible phones.

It can be used in at least two ways:

(1)
Simply launch the application.
You will be prompted to put your phone into the GearVR headset
(unless you are in Oculus developer mode)
and the Oculus Browser will launch once you enter VR.
If there is text in the clipboard, it will open the first URI found.

(2)
Share a URI from your favorite Android application.
You will be prompted to put your phone into the GearVR headset
(unless you are in Oculus developer mode)
and the Oculus Browser will launch once you enter VR,
opening the first URI found in the shared text.

### Privacy

As can be seen from a cursory inspection of the brief source code,
Launch Oculus Browser does not store any data.

Enjoy!
